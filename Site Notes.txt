-The search bar will now search for one name (just the first or just the last name. ex:smith), or it can search a full name if
first and last are provided. Spelling must be correct.

-All of the site html's are now connected to one base. This means that our navigation bar and
search will carry to all pages. The search bar also now redirects to our index html. This allows
us to use the search bar in the player detail page.

-tried to add a more dynamic search using javascrip under the defense/ajax_demo directory.
currently it is not working and i suspect it is an issue loading the javascript, but I am not sure.

2/3/20

-addition of fantasy points added in the player detail screen, as well as stacked bar charts
showing the source of the points. Thus far it only works with default scoring will add custom in
the future.

Plan for new database setup:

Player:
player_id
f_name
l_name

Team:
team_id
name

Stats:
player_id
team_id
year
stat categories

Maybe:
Team_list:
team_id
player_id

##this one will just show what players are on what team##

##Would also like to to game by game for each player this setup would make it easier to implement##
