Plan for new database setup:

Player:
player_id
f_name
l_name

Team:
team_id
name

Stats:
player_id
team_id
year
stat categories

maybe
Team_list:
team_id
player_id

##this one will just show what players are on what team##

##Would also like to to game by game for each player this setup would make it easier to implement##
